      "The Basics\n",
      "It's more than wishful thinking — chocolate can be good for you.\n",
      "Studies show that eating chocolate, primarily dark chocolate, may contribute to improved cardiovascular health. Packed with natural antioxidants, dark chocolate and cocoa sit in the same good-for-you category as green tea and blueberries. That's because chocolate comes from cacao beans (or cocoa beans), which grow on the cacao tree and are full of natural plant nutrients. Most of the studies to date highlight dark chocolate's health values because it has the highest percentage of cocoa solids, therefore more flavanol antioxidants.\n",
      "An Antioxidant Powerhouse\n",
      "Dark chocolate and cocoa are rich in cell-protecting antioxidants -- natural compounds found in fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts. Read what scientists are studying regarding antioxidants and cardiovascular disease, premature aging and cancer.\n",
      "Matters of the Heart\n",
      "Recent studies have shown dark chocolate and cocoa may be good for your heart. In short-term clinical trials, dark chocolate has reduced blood pressure, improved blood flow, showed mild anti-clotting effects and may help prevent plaque formation in arteries.\n",
      "Read about the research on chocolate and your heart.\n",
      "Sweet News For Managing Blood Sugar\n",
      "Despite its sweet reputation, dark chocolate has a low glycemic index similar to that of oatmeal — meaning it does not send your blood sugar spiking. Find out more about the surprising chemistry behind your favorite treat.\n",
      "Vital Minerals\n",
      "Like any plant-based food, chocolate naturally contains an array of minerals. See how chocolate stacks up in critical nutrients.\n",
      "Chocolate and Your Brain\n",
      "Is it more than just the taste? Why does chocolate make us feel good? Discover what chocolate does to your brain.\n",
      "Emerging Science\n",
      "Buoyed by positive findings, more research is being conducted on chocolate's health benefits, including potential cancer-fighting abilities and improved cognitive function. Learn about chocolate's future in health studies.\n",
